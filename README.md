# Data Mining Techniques -- Clustering and Classification

## About

  This is an introductory **Data Mining** project, developed at **Spring of 2017** by
  **Agapiou Marinos** and **Kamaras Georgios** for the Data Mining Techniques course.
  The goal of this project was to get us acquainted with the basic stages of the process that is followed for the application of Data Mining Techniques, being: *collection, pre-process/cleansing, transformation, application of data mining techniques* and *benchmarking*. For the implimentation we use the *Python* programming language and the tools/libraries: *jupyter notebook, pandas, gensim* and *SciKit Learn*.
  
## Parts

* Part 1: Wordcloud creation at wordcloud.ipynb
* Part 2: Clustering implementation, using *K-Means with Cosine Similarity*, at clustering.ipynb
* Part 3: Classification implementation, using *Random Forests*, *Support Vector Machines*, *Naive Bayes* and *K-Nearest Neighbor*, at classification.ipynb
* Part 4: Beat the Benchmark (bonus)
